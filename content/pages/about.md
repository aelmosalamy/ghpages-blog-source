### Who Am I?
Hello there, my name is Adham Elmosalamy.

Welcome to my little piece of the internet where I share my latest experiences, projects and thoughts. I also write beginner-friendly tutorials on various topics.

Though I am mainly a Python guy, I've dabbled with HTML, CSS, Javascript, VB.Net, Lua and Java. I've tried every single thing you can do with a computer, I did stuff like motion tracking and explosive motion graphics in After Effects, all the way to interior design and physics simulations in Cinema4D and Blender, going through logo design and flat art in Inkscape, sprinking some photo manipulation and fancy typography in Photoshop.

As you've obviously noticed, I never gave anything my full time and focus. I took a tiny bite from all, yet I never experienced the true taste of any, so lately I've been focused on programming; I even acquired a Full-Stack Developer Certificate from Udacity and now, I am learning everything I can, often starting mini-projects to challenge myself and to put my knowledge into action.

### Not-So-Long-Term Goals
- Delve into ML with Python.
- Master Basic Game Development Concepts.
- Master Shell-scripting.
- Create a blog - this one - with quality content.
- Start a channel where I teach the stuff I learn.
