Slug: about-me

This is my little piece of the internet where I share my latest experiences, projects and thoughts. I also write beginner-friendly tutorials on various topics.

Though I used Python the most, I actually got my hands dirty with C/C++, Java, PHP, VB.NET, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I've tried every single thing you can do with a computer, I did stuff like motion tracking and explosive motion graphics in After Effects, all the way to interior design and physics simulations in Cinema4D and Blender, going through logo design and flat art in Inkscape, sprinking some photo manipulation and fancy typography in Photoshop.

As you've noticed, I never gave anything my full time and focus. I took a tiny bite from all, yet I never experienced the true taste of any, so lately I've been focused on programming; I even acquired a Full-Stack Developer Certificate from Udacity and now, I am learning everything I can, often starting mini-projects to challenge myself and to put my knowledge into action.
